# Compliance

This directory contains the Compliance Mapping artifacts, supplementing APS-900.

## Documents

| File | Description |

| [TRACEABILITY_MODEL.md](TRACEABILITY_MODEL.md) | Full description of the traceability model |
| [TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md](TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md) | Machine-readable traceability matrix |

## Purpose

Compliance Mapping connects every normative requirement to its evidence of fulfillment. A complete traceability chain is required for certification.

## Full Traceability Chain

```
AURA Constitution Principle
        ↓
APS Requirement (APS-001 through APS-950)
        ↓
Protocol Invariant (INV-xxx)
        ↓
Canonical Data Model Entity (ENT-xxx)
        ↓
Evidence Object / Evidence Pack (APS-300)
        ↓
Conformance Test (CONF-xxx)
        ↓
Reference Fixture (FIX-xxx)

A missing link anywhere in this chain means an incomplete compliance path.
